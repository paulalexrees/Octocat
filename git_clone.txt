Git clone copies a repository locally into a new directory.
It will create the repository folder by itself so git clone needs to be run from inside the project folder you intend to house the repo in, for example ~/Projects

git clone https://github.com/paulalexrees/repo_to_be_cloned.git

Running the above code from Projects would create a folder "repo_to_be_cloned" in your Projects folder.
