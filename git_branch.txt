A branch is a separate direction of commits that can be used to alter files or make changes without affecting the original, located in the 'master' branch.

Switching branches will change the files in your working directory to those related to your current branch.

If the changes you make in a branch are satisfactory, they can then be merged back with another branch to consolidate everything.
